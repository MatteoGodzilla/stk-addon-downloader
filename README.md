# Super Tux Kart Addon Downloader
A command-line tool to manage STK addons to easily search, install, export and import addons.

## How to run
Download NodeJS v18 or greater and clone the repo, install the dependencies with `npm install --omit=dev` then run it with `npm start`

It is ***highly*** recommended to install the program globally using `npm install -g` because of a known issue with how commands are handled by the program. 
If you do not want to install the program globally, it is possible to run it using `npm start --` followed by the command arguments for the program. The double dashes are mandatory

This project is written in Typescript, the actual source files are under `src`
